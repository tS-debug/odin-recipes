        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Korean bibimbap, along with kimchi, takes its place among the favored foods in Korean cuisine. Meaning mixed rice, bibimbap is a popular meal consisting of white rice topped with vegetables, beef, a whole egg, and gochujang (red chili pepper paste). You can substitute with soy sauce or Sriracha (rooster sauce) for those who cannot handle the spiciness, like our children.
